# Dynamic Music

This branch of [c-leri's](https://github.com/c-leri) Dynamic Music comes from 
[Spongecade's](https://github.com/spongecade) [DynamicMusic-Legacy](https://github.com/Spongecade/DynamicMusic-Legacy), both projects being a fork of
[LudoCrypt's](https://github.com/LudoCrypt) [Dynamic Music](https://github.com/LudoCrypt/Dynamic-Music). The sole purpose of this branch,
is to fix some bugs present in Ludocrypt's 1.16 fabric version while also backporting some features from Ludocrypt's fabric 1.17 version
